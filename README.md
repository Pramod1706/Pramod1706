In Jenkins, when you trigger an Ansible Tower job, the credentials used to authenticate with Ansible Tower are configured in the Jenkins system settings. Here’s how you can set it up and use these credentials in your Jenkinsfile:

Configure Ansible Tower Credentials in Jenkins:
Go to Manage Jenkins > Manage Credentials.
Add a new credential with the necessary details (username, password, or API token) for Ansible Tower.
Configure Ansible Tower Server in Jenkins:
Go to Manage Jenkins > Configure System.
Scroll down to the Ansible Tower section.
Add a new Ansible Tower server with the necessary details (name, URL, and the credentials you just added).
Use the Credentials in Your Jenkinsfile:
In your Jenkinsfile, you can reference the Ansible Tower server and the credentials to trigger a job template. Here’s an example:
pipeline {
    agent any
    environment {
        TOWER_SERVER = 'your-tower-server' // Name of the Ansible Tower server configured in Jenkins
        JOB_TEMPLATE = 'your-job-template' // Name of the job template in Ansible Tower
    }
    stages {
        stage('Trigger Ansible Tower Job') {
            steps {
                script {
                    def towerJob = ansibleTower(
                        towerServer: "${TOWER_SERVER}",
                        templateType: 'job',
                        jobTemplate: "${JOB_TEMPLATE}",
                        importTowerLogs: true,
                        removeColor: true,
                        credential: 'your-credential-id', // ID of the credential configured in Jenkins
                        extraVars: [
                            build_number: "${env.BUILD_NUMBER}"
                        ]
                    )
                    echo "Triggered Ansible Tower job with build number: ${env.BUILD_NUMBER}"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

In this example:

TOWER_SERVER is the name of the Ansible Tower server you configured in Jenkins.
JOB_TEMPLATE is the name of the job template in Ansible Tower that you want to trigger.
credential is the ID of the credential you configured in Jenkins for Ansible Tower authentication.
The ansibleTower step triggers the specified job template and passes the Jenkins build number as an extra variable.
This setup ensures that the credentials are securely managed and used to authenticate with Ansible Tower when triggering jobs from Jenkins1.
