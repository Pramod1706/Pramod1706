The error you're encountering is likely due to incorrect YAML syntax. Based on the image, the playbook might be misconfigured. Let's correct it:

Corrected Playbook

Hereâ€™s the revised version of your playbook:

- name: Jenkins Pipeline
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: trigger_jenkins_master_pipeline
      shell: |
        curl -k -X POST \
        https://almjenkinsci-prod.systems.uk.hsbc/et01/job/hsbc-11497556-rating-control-system/job/FX1_control/buildWithParameters \
        --user "{{ custom_username }}:{{ custom_password }}" \
        --data-urlencode "API_Name=123" \
        --data-urlencode "apiVersion=1.1.1"
      register: curl_output

    - name: Print Curl Output
      debug:
        msg: "{{ curl_output.stdout }}"

Explanation:

1. Correct Placement of register: The register should be directly under the task that is registering the output (shell command).


2. Use of debug: The debug module should be used to print out the registered variable (curl_output.stdout).



Try running this corrected playbook. If the error persists or if there are any other issues, please let me know.
