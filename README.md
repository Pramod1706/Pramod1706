To split the input step (to get the password) and the withCredentials block (to use the credentials) across different stages in the Jenkins pipeline, you can store the input password in an environment variable. Then, you can access it within the withCredentials block in another stage.

Here's how to structure this in your Jenkinsfile:

pipeline {
    agent any
    environment {
        USER_PASSWORD = '' // Variable to store the input password globally
    }
    stages {
        stage('Get Password') {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Prompt the user to input the password and store it in the environment variable
                    env.USER_PASSWORD = input(message: 'Please enter your password', parameters: [password(defaultValue: '', description: 'Password for authentication', name: 'PASSWORD')])
                }
            }
        }
        stage('Use Credentials') {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Get the build trigger username
                    def buildUser = currentBuild.rawBuild.getCause(hudson.model.Cause.UserIdCause)?.userId ?: 'unknown'

                    // Use the build username and input password within credentials
                    withCredentials([usernamePassword(credentialsId: 'my-credentials-id', usernameVariable: 'USERNAME', passwordVariable: 'PASSWORD')]) {
                        // Print a statement using the build username and the password entered
                        echo "Build triggered by user: ${buildUser}"
                        echo "Using password entered: ${env.USER_PASSWORD}"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

Explanation:

1. Environment Variable (USER_PASSWORD): Declares a global environment variable to store the input password across stages.


2. Stage Get Password: Prompts the user to enter the password and saves it to USER_PASSWORD.


3. Stage Use Credentials: Retrieves the build trigger username and then uses the withCredentials block to access secure credentials.


4. Printing Statement: The statement uses the build trigger username and the user-provided password stored in USER_PASSWORD.



This separates the input step from the credentials usage while still allowing the password to be accessible securely across stages.
