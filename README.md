# IT Service Recovery Plan (ITSRP) Document

## Overview
This document outlines the IT Service Recovery Plan (ITSRP) for an application running on a Kubernetes platform configured in a round-robin, hot-hot setup for both production and Disaster Recovery (DR) environments. The purpose of this plan is to ensure that critical application services are highly available and can recover quickly from any disruption.

## 1. Application Description
### 1.1. Application Name
- **Name:** [Application Name]

### 1.2. Purpose
- This application provides [brief description of what the application does and its importance].

### 1.3. Components
- **Frontend:** ReactJS application served by Nginx.
- **Backend:** Node.js/Express server.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL.
- **Other Services:** Redis for caching, RabbitMQ for messaging.

## 2. Infrastructure Setup
### 2.1. Kubernetes Clusters
- **Production Cluster:**
  - Location: [Data Center 1 / Cloud Region 1]
  - Cluster Name: prod-cluster-1
- **DR Cluster:**
  - Location: [Data Center 2 / Cloud Region 2]
  - Cluster Name: dr-cluster-1

### 2.2. Configuration
- **Load Balancing:** Implemented via external load balancer (e.g., AWS ELB, Google Cloud Load Balancer) in a round-robin configuration.
- **Namespace:** Separate Kubernetes namespaces for different environments (e.g., `prod`, `dr`).
- **Replication:** All services are deployed in both clusters with identical configurations.
- **Data Synchronization:** Database and stateful services are synchronized between clusters using [replication technology, e.g., PostgreSQL streaming replication].

## 3. Recovery Strategy
### 3.1. Hot-Hot Configuration
- Both production and DR environments are active at all times.
- Traffic is distributed between both clusters using DNS round-robin or a load balancer.

### 3.2. Monitoring and Alerts
- **Monitoring Tools:** Prometheus, Grafana.
- **Alerting Tools:** Alertmanager, PagerDuty.
- Critical metrics and logs are monitored, and alerts are configured for:
  - Service availability.
  - Performance degradation.
  - Resource utilization.
  - Data replication status.

### 3.3. Backup Strategy
- **Database Backups:**
  - Daily full backups.
  - Transaction log backups every 15 minutes.
- **Configuration Backups:**
  - Daily backups of Kubernetes manifests, Helm charts, and configuration files.

### 3.4. Testing and Drills
- **Failover Drills:** Conducted quarterly to ensure the DR plan's effectiveness.
- **Backup Restoration Tests:** Performed monthly to verify backup integrity and restoration process.

## 4. Recovery Procedures
### 4.1. Detecting an Incident
- Incident detection through monitoring alerts.
- Automated scripts to check service health at regular intervals.

### 4.2. Initial Response
1. **Acknowledge Alert:** Confirm receipt of the alert and begin incident logging.
2. **Assessment:** Determine the scope and impact of the incident.
3. **Communication:** Notify stakeholders and relevant teams.

### 4.3. Failover Process
1. **Activate DR Cluster:**
   - Redirect traffic to the DR cluster using the load balancer or update DNS records.
2. **Scale Services:**
   - Ensure all necessary services in the DR cluster are scaled to handle full load.
3. **Validate Services:**
   - Confirm that all services in the DR cluster are operational and handling traffic.

### 4.4. Data Recovery
1. **Database Failover:**
   - Ensure the DR cluster's database is promoted to primary if necessary.
2. **Data Synchronization:**
   - Verify that data replication is current and consistent.

### 4.5. Restoration to Normal Operations
1. **Incident Resolution:**
   - Identify and resolve the root cause in the production cluster.
2. **Switch Back:**
   - Gradually redirect traffic back to the production cluster once it is stable.
3. **Post-Incident Review:**
   - Conduct a post-mortem analysis to document the incident and improve future responses.

## 5. Roles and Responsibilities
### 5.1. IT Operations Team
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Monitor application and infrastructure.
  - Respond to alerts and incidents.
  - Conduct regular failover drills and backup tests.

### 5.2. Development Team
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Ensure application code is resilient and supports failover.
  - Collaborate with the operations team during incidents.

### 5.3. Business Continuity Team
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Oversee the execution of the ITSRP.
  - Ensure communication with stakeholders.

## 6. Communication Plan
### 6.1. Internal Communication
- **Channels:** Slack, Email, PagerDuty.
- **Frequency:** Immediate notification during incidents, regular updates during recovery, post-incident review meetings.

### 6.2. External Communication
- **Stakeholders:** Clients, partners, and users.
- **Channels:** Email, status page updates, social media if necessary.

## 7. Documentation and Maintenance
### 7.1. Documentation
- Maintain updated documentation of the ITSRP, including procedures, contact lists, and configuration details.

### 7.2. Review and Update
- Review and update the ITSRP semi-annually or after any significant change in infrastructure or application architecture.

## 8. Conclusion
The IT Service Recovery Plan ensures that [Application Name] can maintain high availability and quickly recover from any disruptions. Regular testing, monitoring, and updating of this plan are critical to its success.
