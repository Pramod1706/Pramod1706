Production Deployment Process Using Jenkins and Ansible

This document outlines the steps involved in deploying code to the production environment using Jenkins and Ansible. The process integrates with Jira to manage ticket creation, approvals, and change requests (CRs) to ensure a smooth and well-coordinated production deployment.

1. Overview

The deployment workflow is managed through Jenkins, which triggers various jobs to handle deployments across different environments (e.g., Development, Testing, Staging). When it is time for production deployment, a dedicated Ansible workflow template is triggered. This process ensures all necessary checks and approvals are in place before the actual deployment.

2. Production Deployment Workflow

The following steps describe the production deployment process:

1. Jenkins Pipeline Execution

A Jenkins job is initiated, which handles deployments across all environments.

When it is time for the production deployment, the pipeline triggers an Ansible workflow template that manages the production-specific tasks.



2. Creating a Jira Ticket

The Ansible workflow template starts by automatically creating a Jira ticket for the production deployment.

This ticket contains details about the deployment, including changes to be made, the scheduled date/time, and any additional information required for approval.

The Jira ticket is assigned to the development team, who need to review and edit the details as needed.



3. Developer Review & Approval

Developers are responsible for reviewing the Jira ticket, ensuring all the details are accurate, and making any necessary updates.

Once the ticket is reviewed, it is marked as "Ready for Approval."



4. Team Leader Approval

The team leader receives a notification to review the updated Jira ticket.

After verification, the team leader provides approval by closing the ticket.



5. Creating a Change Request (CR)

Upon ticket closure, Ansible automatically creates a Change Request (CR) based on the Jira ticket information.

The CR is scheduled to specify the exact date and time for the production deployment.

The CR is reviewed and approved as per the organization's change management policies.



6. Scheduled Production Deployment

Once the CR is approved, the production deployment is scheduled according to the specified time in the CR.

Jenkins executes the deployment job using the predefined Ansible workflow template, ensuring that the process is executed consistently and reliably.



7. Completion & Verification

After the deployment is complete, the Jenkins job verifies the deployment status and confirms the successful release to production.

Any post-deployment steps, such as monitoring and alerting, are activated to ensure the stability of the production environment.




3. Key Components

Jenkins: Automates the entire deployment process by triggering different jobs based on the environment and integrating with Ansible.

Ansible: Manages the automation of deployment tasks, Jira ticket creation, and CR scheduling for production releases.

Jira: Used for ticket management to ensure all deployment details are tracked, reviewed, and approved before proceeding to production.

Change Request (CR): Ensures that the deployment is scheduled and approved by relevant stakeholders, following organizational policies.


4. Advantages of the Workflow

Automation: Automating the process reduces manual effort and minimizes the risk of human error.

Traceability: Integration with Jira ensures that every change is documented, reviewed, and approved, providing a clear audit trail.

Consistency: Ansible templates standardize the deployment process across all environments, ensuring consistency.

Flexibility: The workflow can easily be extended to accommodate new requirements or environments.

                                             +------------------------------+

6. Conclusion

This process ensures that production deployments are executed with proper oversight, traceability, and consistency. By automating tasks using Jenkins and Ansible, the deployment process becomes streamlined, reducing potential risks and ensuring successful releases.
