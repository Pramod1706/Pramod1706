The error in the screenshot indicates an issue with the sed command, specifically with how the reference (\1) in the replacement part of the expression is used. This typically occurs when sed does not correctly capture the group in the () or the syntax for grouping and referencing is not correctly specified.

Here is the corrected version of the sed command:

Fixed Playbook Sections for Parsing

Replace the sed commands in the playbook with the updated ones below:

- name: Parse OIDC ID Token
      shell: |
        echo '{{ oidc_tokens.stdout }}' | grep -o '"id_token":"[^"]*"' | sed 's/"id_token":"[^"]*"/\1/'
      register: oidc_id_token
      changed_when: false

    - name: Parse OIDC Refresh Token
      shell: |
        echo '{{ oidc_tokens.stdout }}' | grep -o '"refresh_token":"[^"]*"' | sed 's/"refresh_token":"[^"]*"/\1/'
      register: oidc_refresh_token
      changed_when: false

Explanation of Fix

In sed, grouping must be done with  and  instead of just () in some shells, particularly when using basic regular expressions.

The \1 is used to reference the first captured group, and this syntax requires the grouping parentheses to be escaped.


Debugging Steps

If you encounter issues again, you can debug the parsing step as follows:

1. Run the commands interactively on the host where the playbook is being executed.


2. Verify the output of grep and ensure it matches the expected id_token or refresh_token field.


3. Test the sed command independently with the input.
