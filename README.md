Build Environment Setup
Source Control: Configure access to the Git repository at [Git repository URL].
Build Server: Set up a build server using [Jenkins/CircleCI/GitHub Actions/etc.].
Build Tools: Install and configure build tools such as [Maven/Gradle/npm/etc.].
Artifact Repository: Establish an artifact repository using [Nexus/Artifactory/etc.] for versioning and storing build artifacts.
Deployment Environment Setup
Infrastructure Provisioning: Automate the provisioning of servers using tools like Terraform or AWS CloudFormation.
Configuration Management: Use Ansible, Chef, or Puppet for configuration management to maintain consistency across environments.
Middleware Setup: Install and configure necessary middleware, including web servers, database servers, etc.
Network Configuration: Set up load balancers, firewalls, and other network components to ensure secure and balanced traffic distribution.
Detailed Build Process
Code Checkout: Automate the checkout of the latest code from the main branch using build server hooks.
Dependency Resolution: Implement a dependency management process to install required libraries and frameworks.
Compilation: Compile the source code into binary artifacts, ensuring error handling for compilation failures.
Automated Testing: Integrate automated unit and integration tests within the build process to ensure code quality.
Artifact Packaging: Package the compiled binaries into deployable formats like WAR, JAR, or Docker images.
Artifact Promotion: Promote the build artifacts through different stages (dev, test, prod) with proper version tagging.
Detailed Deployment Process
Environment Validation: Perform pre-deployment checks to validate the health and readiness of the target environment.
Downtime Management: Communicate planned downtime to stakeholders and prepare for service unavailability if necessary.
Artifact Deployment: Retrieve the specific versioned artifact from the repository and deploy it using CI/CD pipelines.
Database Migration: Execute any required database migrations or schema changes in coordination with the deployment.
Service Restart: Restart services or applications as needed to apply new configurations and changes.
Smoke Testing: Conduct smoke tests to ensure basic functionality works as expected post-deployment.
Verification and Validation
Health Checks: Implement automated health checks to verify system stability and operational status.
Performance Testing: Conduct performance testing to ensure the application meets the required benchmarks.
Rollback and Recovery Plan
Automated Rollback: Set up automated rollback mechanisms to revert to the previous stable version in case of a failed deployment.
Data Recovery: Ensure data backup procedures are in place and tested regularly for quick recovery in case of data loss.
Security and Compliance
Access Control: Enforce strict access controls to both build and deployment environments.
Secrets Management: Securely manage secrets and credentials using tools like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager.
Compliance Audits: Regularly perform compliance audits to adhere to industry standards and regulations.
Monitoring and Logging
Real-time Monitoring: Utilize tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or New Relic for real-time application and infrastructure monitoring.
Log Aggregation: Aggregate logs using solutions like ELK Stack or Splunk for centralized logging and analysis.
Troubleshooting Guide
Issue Tracking: Document common deployment issues and their resolutions in a knowledge base.
Log Analysis: Provide guidelines for analyzing logs to troubleshoot and identify root causes of issues.
Appendix
Scripts and Commands: Include detailed build and deployment scripts or commands used throughout the process.
Configuration Samples: Attach sample configuration files and templates for reference.
Please ensure to replace placeholders with actual values and details specific to your application and infrastructure. This document should be reviewed and updated regularly to reflect any changes in the build and deployment process. üõ†Ô∏èüö¢
