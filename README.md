Absolutely. Let’s now explain everything from scratch, clearly and simply, so you understand exactly:

✅ Why this is happening

🔥 What’s causing it

🚫 Why tuning pod or JVM won’t help alone

✅ What exactly you must fix in your application code

🛠️ What tools/settings help after fixing the code



---

🧠 THE FULL STORY — FROM SCRATCH


---

1️⃣ Your Setup:

Setting	Value

Heap size	3 GB (-Xmx3g)
Pod memory limit	5 GB
GC type	G1GC (✅ good)
JVM tuning	Fairly optimized (✅)
Framework	Spring Boot app, possibly REST APIs calling DB or external APIs



---

2️⃣ The Problem (Based on Your Heap Dump):

Your heap dump shows:

> One thread (request handler) is using ~1.2 GB memory!
This is a single HTTP request, not a leak across many requests.



🔍 Seen in:

org.apache.tomcat.util.threads.TaskThread

java.util.Arrays.copyOf

org.springframework.http.HttpEntity

AbstractHttpRequestHandler.makeActualRequest


This means:

> You're likely calling an API or DB that returns huge data, and the code loads everything into memory during a single HTTP request.




---

3️⃣ What Happens Inside JVM:

Step	What JVM Does

🧠 Request starts	New thread handles the HTTP request
📥 App fetches data	Calls DB or external service
🏋️ App loads all data into memory	E.g., reads huge list, map, array, or file
🔁 Copies and holds data	Seen in Arrays.copyOf
💥 JVM tries to manage memory	G1GC does its best
🚫 Memory exceeds 5 GB	Kubernetes detects and kills pod (OOM)



---

4️⃣ Why It Keeps Restarting

Because the same bad request keeps hitting your app.

> One large request = 💣 BOOM!

It uses 1.2 GB+, triggering OOM repeatedly.



So pod restarts… but when same/big request hits again — crash again.


---

5️⃣ ❌ Why Pod Setup or JVM Tuning Doesn’t Help

Fix Tried	Result

Increase pod memory	Just delays crash (uses more but still OOMs)
Tune GC	G1GC helps… but can’t save you from 1.2 GB single thread
Add replicas	Each replica will crash if same request hits it


So unless you fix the code that holds big data, it will keep happening.


---

✅ WHAT TO DO TO FIX IT (Step-by-step)


---

✅ 1. Fix the Root: Code Refactor Needed

Go to the method:

AbstractHttpRequestHandler.makeActualRequest()

📌 You’re likely doing things like:

HttpEntity<?> response = restTemplate.exchange(...);
List<Object> data = response.getBody(); // 💣 Large list in memory

Or:

List<?> result = jdbcTemplate.query(...); // 💣 All rows in one list

✅ What to do:

Case	Fix

Fetching from DB	Use pagination or streaming (@QueryHints, fetchSize, scrollable cursor)
External API returns big JSON	Parse response using streaming parser (Jackson Streaming API, JsonParser)
Reading file	Use BufferedReader/InputStream, not .readAll()
Creating object copy	Avoid Arrays.copyOf(largeData) — refactor to avoid full clone



---

✅ 2. Add Request Safeguards

Layer	What to Add

Ingress/NGINX	Limit request body size:
client_max_body_size 5M;	
Spring Boot	Use spring.servlet.multipart.max-request-size and spring.http.multipart.max-request-size
Controller	Validate incoming request params — prevent huge result sets
DB query	Always use LIMIT, pagination, or streaming



---

✅ 3. JVM Safeguards (Keep using)

Keep these:

-Xmx3g -Xms3g
-XX:+UseG1GC
-XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=512m
-XX:+ExitOnOutOfMemoryError
-XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError


---

✅ 4. Monitoring & Logs

Use:

heapdump.hprof — to confirm post-fix memory stays low

gc.log — track pause times

Prometheus + Grafana — to graph heap, pod memory, request count



---

🧪 5. Load Test After Fix

Use JMeter or Gatling to:

Simulate 50, 100, 200 concurrent requests

Ensure no thread holds >300–400MB

Confirm memory usage doesn’t grow linearly with load



---

🧠 TL;DR Summary

Layer	Fix

❌ Problem	Code loads too much data in memory for a single request
🔥 Why it crashes	JVM heap gets consumed, pod memory crosses 5 GB, OOM Kill
✅ Real Fix	Refactor code to stream data, not load all at once
✅ After Fix	Tune JVM, GC, set resource limits, add request guards
🚫 Don't rely only on	Increasing memory or tuning GC — they only delay the crash
